# PawsomeActivities
A final project of iOS development course, PawsomActivities is an app where you can find a set of random activities you can do when you are bored, complemented with cute dogs' photos. You also can add activities to the "favorite list", so you will be able to return back to them after closing the app and re-opening it.
